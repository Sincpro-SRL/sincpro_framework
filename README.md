## 🔍 Overview of Hexagonal Architecture

Hexagonal Architecture, also known as **Ports and Adapters**, is an architectural approach that aims to decouple core business logic from external dependencies. It organizes the system into distinct layers: domain, application, and infrastructure, enhancing maintainability, scalability, and adaptability.

### 🏗️ Key Layers of Hexagonal Architecture

- **Core Domain**: This layer encapsulates essential entities, value objects, and domain services representing the core business rules and behaviors. It is kept strictly independent from infrastructure concerns, preserving business logic integrity.
- **Application Layer**: Orchestrates user requests, processes domain responses, and mediates interactions between domain and external systems to ensure effective workflow execution.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Contains adapters for interacting with databases, APIs, messaging systems, and other services. It handles data transformation to ensure compatibility with the domain and application layers.

### 🤔 Why Use a Unified Bus Pattern?

The Sincpro Framework adopts a **unified bus pattern** as a single point of entry for managing use cases, dependencies, and services within a bounded context. This simplifies the architecture by encapsulating all requirements of a given context, ensuring a clear and consistent structure.

Using a unified bus allows developers to access all dependencies through a single environment, eliminating the need for repeated imports or initialization. This approach ensures each bounded context is self-sufficient, independently scalable, and minimizes coupling while enhancing modularity.

## 🔑 Key Features of the Sincpro Framework

The Sincpro Framework follows hexagonal architecture principles, promoting modularity, scalability, and development efficiency. Here are its core features:

### ✅ DTO Validation with Pydantic

- Utilizes **Pydantic** to validate Data Transfer Objects (DTOs).
- Ensures only well-structured data is allowed into core business logic, reducing errors and maintaining data integrity.

### 🧩 Dependency Injection

- Facilitates integration of user-defined dependencies, promoting modular design.
- Enhances unit testing by allowing easy mocking or replacement of dependencies.

### 🔄 Inversion of Control (IoC)

- Automates the instantiation and configuration of components, reducing boilerplate code.
- Encourages loose coupling, making systems more adaptable and maintainable.

### ⚠️ Error Handling at Different Levels

- Provides centralized error handling at multiple levels: **global**, **Service Application**, and **Feature** levels.
- Ensures consistent error management, improving overall reliability.

### 🚌 Bus Pattern for Component Communication

- Implements a bus mechanism to facilitate communication between **Feature** and **ApplicationService** components.
- Decouples component interactions, resulting in more flexible and scalable business logic.

### 🧩 Decoupled Logic Execution

- Supports independent execution of use cases through the **Feature** component, promoting separation of concerns.
- For example, a user registration workflow can be broken down into steps like input validation, profile creation, and email notification.

### 🎻 Application Service Orchestration

- Uses a **feature bus** to orchestrate multiple features into complex business workflows (e.g., customer onboarding).
- Integrates smaller use cases into cohesive flows to manage entire business processes effectively.

### 💻 IDE Support with Typing

- Uses type hints to enhance code quality and support features like autocompletion and type checking.
- Improves development efficiency and reliability.

## ⚙️ Features vs. Application Service

- **Feature**: Represents a discrete, self-contained use case focused on specific functionality, easy to develop and maintain.
- **ApplicationService**: Orchestrates multiple features for broader business objectives, providing reusable components and workflows.

## 💳 Example Usage for a Payment Gateway

The following example shows how to configure the Sincpro Framework for a payment gateway integration, such as CyberSource. It is recommended to name the framework instance to clearly represent the bounded context it serves.

### 🔧 Configuring the Framework

To set up the Sincpro Framework, configuration should be performed at the application layer within the `use_cases` directory of each bounded context.

### 📋 Best Practices for Imports

Each use case should import both the **DTO for input parameters** and the **DTO for responses** to maintain clarity and consistency.

### 📝 Sample Configuration in `__init__.py`

```python
from typing import Type

from sincpro_framework import Feature as _Feature
from sincpro_framework import UseFramework as _UseFramework
from sincpro_framework import ApplicationService as _ApplicationService

from sincpro_payments_sdk.apps.cybersource.adapters.cybersource_rest_api_adapter import (
    ESupportedCardType,
    TokenizationAdapter,
)
from sincpro_payments_sdk.infrastructure.orm import with_transaction as db_session
from sincpro_payments_sdk.infrastructure.aws_services import AwsService as aws_service
from sincpro_payments_sdk.infrastructure.logger import cybersource_logger as logger

# Create an instance of the framework
cybersource = _UseFramework()

# Register dependencies
cybersource.add_dependency("token_adapter", TokenizationAdapter())
cybersource.add_dependency("ECardType", ESupportedCardType)
cybersource.add_dependency("db_session", db_session)
cybersource.add_dependency("aws_service", aws_service)
cybersource.add_dependency("logger", logger)

# Define a custom Feature class to access the dependencies
class Feature(_Feature):
    token_adapter: TokenizationAdapter
    ECardType: Type[ESupportedCardType]
    db_session: ...
    aws_service: ...
    logger: ...

# Define a custom Application Service class to access dependencies
class ApplicationService(_ApplicationService):
    token_adapter: TokenizationAdapter
    ECardType: Type[ESupportedCardType]
    db_session: ...
    aws_service: ...
    logger: ...
    feature_bus: ...

# Add use cases (Application Services and Features)
from . import tokenization

__all__ = ["cybersource", "tokenization", "Feature"]
```

## 🛠️ Creating a Feature

To create a new **Feature**, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Module for the Feature**: Add a new Python file in the appropriate folder under `use_cases`.
2. **Import the Framework and Required Classes**: Import the configured framework instance and `DataTransferObject`.
3. **Define the Parameter and Response DTOs**: Use `DataTransferObject` to create classes for input parameters and responses.
4. **Create the Feature Class**: Define the `Feature` class by inheriting from the custom `Feature` class.

### 🖋️ Example of Creating a Feature

```python
from sincpro_payments_sdk.apps.cybersource import cybersource, DataTransferObject, Feature

# Define parameter DTO
class TokenizationParams(DataTransferObject):
    card_number: str
    expiration_date: str
    cardholder_name: str

# Define response DTO
class TokenizationResponse(DataTransferObject):
    token: str
    status: str

# Create the Feature class
@cybersource.feature(TokenizationParams)
class NewTokenizationFeature(Feature):
    def execute(self, dto: TokenizationParams) -> TokenizationResponse:
        # Example usage of dependencies
        self.logger.info("Starting tokenization process")
        token = self.token_adapter.create_token(
            card_number=dto.card_number,
            expiration_date=dto.expiration_date,
            cardholder_name=dto.cardholder_name
        )
        return TokenizationResponse(token=token, status="success")
```

## 🔄 Creating an Application Service

**ApplicationService** is used to coordinate multiple features while maintaining reusability and consistency. It orchestrates features into cohesive workflows.

### 💡 Example of Creating an Application Service

```python
from sincpro_payments_sdk.apps.cybersource import cybersource, DataTransferObject, ApplicationService
from sincpro_payments_sdk.apps.cybersource.use_cases.tokenization import TokenizationParams

# Define parameter DTO
class PaymentServiceParams(DataTransferObject):
    card_number: str
    expiration_date: str
    cardholder_name: str
    amount: float

# Define response DTO
class PaymentServiceResponse(DataTransferObject):
    status: str
    transaction_id: str

# Create the Application Service class
@cybersource.app_service(PaymentServiceParams)
class PaymentOrchestrationService(ApplicationService):
    def execute(self, dto: PaymentServiceParams) -> PaymentServiceResponse:
        # Create the command DTO for tokenization
        tokenization_command = TokenizationParams(
            card_number=dto.card_number,
            expiration_date=dto.expiration_date,
            cardholder_name=dto.cardholder_name
        )
        tokenization_result = self.feature_bus.execute(tokenization_command)
        
        # Example usage of dependencies
        self.logger.info("Proceeding with payment after tokenization")
        # Proceed with payment using the token (pseudo code for payment processing)
        transaction_id = "12345"  # Simulated transaction ID
        return PaymentServiceResponse(status="success", transaction_id=transaction_id)
```

## ⚙️ Executing a Use Case

Once a **Feature** or **ApplicationService** is defined, it can be executed by passing the appropriate **DTO** instance.

### 📌 Example of Executing a Use Case

```python
from sincpro_payments_sdk.apps.cybersource import cybersource
from sincpro_payments_sdk.apps.cybersource.use_cases.tokenization import TokenizationParams
from sincpro_payments_sdk.apps.cybersource.use_cases.payments import PaymentServiceParams

# Example of executing a Feature
feature_dto = TokenizationParams(
    card_number="4111111111111111",
    expiration_date="12/25",
    cardholder_name="John Doe"
)

# Execute the feature
feature_result = cybersource.feature_bus.execute(feature_dto)
print(f"Tokenization Result: {feature_result.token}, Status: {feature_result.status}")

# Example of executing an Application Service
service_dto = PaymentServiceParams(
    card_number="4111111111111111",
    expiration_date="12/25",
    cardholder_name="John Doe",
    amount=100.00
)

# Execute the application service
service_result = cybersource.feature_bus.execute(service_dto)
print(f"Payment Status: {service_result.status}, Transaction ID: {service_result.transaction_id}")
```
